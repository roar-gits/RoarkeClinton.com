        <section class="metric-card" id="metric-dau" data-tags="growth,engagement,health" data-name="Daily Active Users">
        <h3>Daily Active Users (DAU)</h3>
        <p><em>Unique users who engage with your product in a single day.</em></p>
        <blockquote>DAU = Unique users with ≥1 qualifying action per day</blockquote>
        <h4>What it measures</h4>
        <p> Count of unique users with at least one qualifying action in a 24-hour period. What counts as "active" is product-specific: it might be logging in, viewing content, or completing a core action like sending a message.</p>
        <h4>What to watch</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Rising</strong>: Indicates growing engagement, but verify sustainability. A viral spike that fades within 7-14 days signals temporary interest, not real growth. Pair with retention metrics.</li>
          <li><strong>Falling</strong>: Could signal product issues, seasonality, or a shift in user behavior. Segment by cohort to identify whether it's new user acquisition or existing user engagement that's declining.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>In practice</h4>
        <p> After launching push notifications, a productivity app saw DAU jump 40% in week one. But sessions per user dropped from 3.2 to 1.8. <strong>Users opened the app more but did less each time.</strong> The team shifted to weekly digest notifications, which recovered session depth while maintaining the DAU gain.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="metric-card" id="metric-spu" data-tags="engagement,retention" data-name="Sessions Per User">
        <h3>Sessions Per User (SPU)</h3>
        <p><em>How often users return to your product in a given period.</em></p>
        <blockquote>SPU = Total sessions / Total unique users</blockquote>
        <h4>What it measures</h4>
        <p> Average number of separate sessions per user over a given period. A session typically ends after 30 minutes of inactivity, though this varies by platform.</p>
        <h4>What to watch</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Rising</strong>: Users are returning more frequently, a sign of habit formation. High-frequency products (messaging, social) should target 3+ daily sessions; lower-frequency products (finance, travel) may see 2-4 weekly.</li>
          <li><strong>Falling</strong>: Users may be consolidating activity into fewer, longer sessions (not necessarily bad) or losing interest. Cross-reference with session duration to distinguish these cases.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>In practice</h4>
        <p> A news app saw SPU rise from 1.4 to 2.1 after launching personalized feeds, but average session duration dropped 30%. <strong>Users were snacking on headlines rather than reading articles.</strong> The team added a "deep read" mode and saw both metrics improve together.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="metric-card" id="metric-activation" data-tags="growth,leading" data-name="Activation Rate">
        <h3>Activation Rate</h3>
        <p><em>Percentage of new users who reach a meaningful first milestone.</em></p>
        <blockquote>Activation Rate = (Users who activated / Total new users) × 100%</blockquote>
        <h4>What it measures</h4>
        <p> Percentage of new users who complete a predefined action that correlates with long-term retention. The "activation event" varies by product: it might be completing a profile, making a first post, or experiencing a core feature.</p>
        <h4>What to watch</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Rising</strong>: Onboarding is working. More users are reaching the "aha moment." Strong products typically see 20-40% activation within the first session; exceptional ones reach 60%+.</li>
          <li><strong>Falling</strong>: Check for friction in onboarding, unclear value props, or technical issues. Also verify your activation event still correlates with retention, as it may need updating as your product evolves.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>In practice</h4>
        <p> A project management tool defined activation as "create first project." After reducing the setup flow from 8 steps to 3, activation rose from 34% to 52%. But when they analyzed retention, <strong>users who also invited a teammate had 3× better retention</strong>, so they added teammate invitation to their activation definition.</p>

        <section class="metric-card" id="metric-mrr" data-tags="growth,monetization,health" data-name="Monthly Recurring Revenue">
        <h3>Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)</h3>
        <p><em>Total predictable monthly revenue from subscriptions.</em></p>
        <blockquote>MRR = Sum of each customer's monthly subscription value</blockquote>
        <h4>What it measures</h4>
        <p> Sum of all active subscription revenue, normalized to a monthly value. For annual plans, divide by 12. MRR is the heartbeat metric for subscription businesses.</p>
        <h4>What to watch</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Rising</strong>: Growth is coming from new customers (New MRR), existing customers upgrading (Expansion MRR), or both. Break down MRR by source to understand what's driving growth.</li>
          <li><strong>Falling</strong>: Churn and downgrades are outpacing new business. Calculate Net MRR (New + Expansion − Churn − Contraction) to see the full picture.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>In practice</h4>
        <p> A B2B SaaS company saw MRR grow 8% month-over-month, but when they decomposed it, <strong>70% came from expansion revenue and only 30% from new sales</strong>. They doubled down on upsell features while rebuilding their top-of-funnel acquisition.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="metric-card" id="metric-arpu" data-tags="monetization,health" data-name="Average Revenue Per User">
        <h3>Average Revenue Per User (ARPU)</h3>
        <p><em>Revenue generated per user over a period.</em></p>
        <blockquote>ARPU = Total revenue / Total users</blockquote>
        <h4>What it measures</h4>
        <p> Revenue per user over a specific period, typically monthly. Clarify whether you're measuring paying users only (ARPPU) or all users including free tier, as these are very different numbers.</p>
        <h4>What to watch</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Rising</strong>: Users are paying more through upgrades, add-ons, or price increases. But watch for declining user count: ARPU can rise while total revenue falls if you're losing lower-value customers.</li>
          <li><strong>Falling</strong>: Could indicate successful expansion into a lower-price segment (growth dilution), increased discounting, or downgrades. Segment by customer tier to understand the cause.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>In practice</h4>
        <p> A streaming service launched a lower-priced ad-supported tier, causing ARPU to drop from $14 to $11. But total revenue grew 40% because the subscriber base doubled. <strong>The ARPU decline was intentional, a trade-off for market expansion.</strong></p>
        </section>

        <section class="metric-card" id="metric-ltv" data-tags="monetization,retention" data-name="Lifetime Value">
        <h3>Lifetime Value (LTV)</h3>
        <p><em>Total projected revenue from a customer over their entire relationship.</em></p>
        <blockquote>LTV = ARPU × Gross Margin % × (1 / Churn Rate)<br>E-commerce: Avg. order value × Purchase frequency × Avg. customer lifespan</blockquote>
        <h4>What it measures</h4>
        <p> Projected total revenue from a customer over their entire relationship with your product. LTV is an estimate based on historical patterns.</p>
        <h4>What to watch</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Rising</strong>: Customers are staying longer, spending more, or both. The critical ratio is LTV:CAC. Most healthy businesses target at least 3:1 (every dollar spent acquiring a customer returns three dollars).</li>
          <li><strong>Falling</strong>: Investigate whether it's driven by shorter lifespans (retention problem), lower spending (engagement or pricing problem), or both. Segment by acquisition channel, as some sources may deliver lower-quality customers.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>In practice</h4>
        <p> An e-commerce company launched a loyalty program and saw LTV rise from $180 to $245, a 36% increase. But CAC also rose 25% because the loyalty program's marketing costs weren't attributed. <strong>When they calculated LTV:CAC, it only improved from 2.4:1 to 2.6:1</strong>, prompting them to optimize the program's costs.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="metric-card" id="metric-nps" data-tags="retention,leading,health" data-name="Net Promoter Score">
        <h3>Net Promoter Score (NPS)</h3>
        <p><em>How likely customers are to recommend you. Benchmark: 30+ good, 50+ excellent, 70+ world-class.</em></p>
        <blockquote>NPS = % Promoters − % Detractors (ranges from −100 to +100)</blockquote>
        <h4>What it measures</h4>
        <p> A loyalty metric based on one question: "How likely are you to recommend us?" (0-10 scale). Respondents are grouped as Promoters (9-10), Passives (7-8), or Detractors (0-6).</p>
        <h4>What to watch</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Rising</strong>: Improving loyalty. But NPS varies by industry, so compare to competitors rather than absolute benchmarks.</li>
          <li><strong>Falling</strong>: Investigate qualitative feedback from Detractors. A small NPS drop may reflect a vocal minority; a sustained decline signals systemic issues.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>In practice</h4>
        <p> A hospitality app redesigned its booking flow and saw NPS jump from 32 to 48. But when they segmented by user type, <strong>power users' NPS actually dropped</strong> (they missed removed shortcuts). The team added back keyboard shortcuts for frequent bookers while keeping the simplified flow for casual users.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="metric-card" id="metric-csat" data-tags="retention,leading" data-name="Customer Satisfaction Rate">
        <h3>Customer Satisfaction Rate (CSAT)</h3>
        <p><em>Satisfaction with a specific interaction. Target: 80%+ for B2C, 90%+ for B2B enterprise.</em></p>
        <blockquote>CSAT = (Satisfied responses / Total responses) × 100%</blockquote>
        <h4>What it measures</h4>
        <p> Satisfaction score for a specific interaction or experience, typically via a survey ("How satisfied were you?" on a 1-5 scale). Unlike NPS, which gauges overall loyalty, CSAT is best for evaluating specific touchpoints.</p>
        <h4>What to watch</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Rising</strong>: The specific experience you're measuring is improving. Watch response rates, as low participation can skew results toward extremes.</li>
          <li><strong>Falling</strong>: Something changed in that touchpoint. Because CSAT is context-specific, you can often pinpoint the issue. Compare before/after when you make changes.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>In practice</h4>
        <p> An online education platform added video transcripts and saw course CSAT rise from 72% to 86%. But completion rates didn't improve. <strong>Learners were more satisfied but using transcripts to skim rather than engage.</strong> They redesigned transcripts as a supplement rather than an alternative to video.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="metric-card" id="metric-crr" data-tags="retention,health" data-name="Customer Retention Rate">
        <h3>Customer Retention Rate (CRR)</h3>
        <p><em>Percentage of existing customers who stay. Target: 90%+ monthly for subscriptions.</em></p>
        <blockquote>CRR = ((Customers at end − New customers) / Customers at start) × 100%</blockquote>
        <h4>What it measures</h4>
        <p> Percentage of existing customers who remain active over a period. The key is excluding new customers: you're measuring whether people who were already customers stayed.</p>
        <h4>What to watch</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Rising</strong>: Your existing customers are stickier. Even small retention improvements compound dramatically over time.</li>
          <li><strong>Falling</strong>: Something is driving existing customers away. Segment by cohort, tenure, and usage patterns to find who's leaving and when. Early-tenure churn points to onboarding issues; late-tenure churn suggests value erosion.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>In practice</h4>
        <p> A fitness app saw CRR drop from 85% to 78% after adding new workout types. <strong>The new content overwhelmed the home screen, and existing users couldn't find their saved workouts.</strong> Restoring a "My Workouts" quick-access tab recovered retention to 87%.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="metric-card" id="metric-churn" data-tags="retention,health,leading" data-name="Customer Churn Rate">
        <h3>Customer Churn Rate</h3>
        <p><em>Percentage of customers who leave. Target: &lt;5% annual for B2B SaaS, 5-7% monthly for B2C.</em></p>
        <blockquote>Churn Rate = (Customers lost during period / Customers at start) × 100%</blockquote>
        <h4>What it measures</h4>
        <p> Percentage of customers who cancel or stop using your product over a period. Churn is the inverse of retention (Churn + Retention = 100%), but tracking both provides different analytical lenses.</p>
        <h4>What to watch</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Rising</strong>: Customers are leaving faster. Context matters: some churn is healthy if you're shedding low-fit customers.</li>
          <li><strong>Falling</strong>: Your product is stickier. Track revenue churn alongside customer churn, since losing many small customers may hurt less than losing a few large ones.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>In practice</h4>
        <p> An online learning platform saw monthly churn spike from 6% to 11% after a price increase. But when they segmented by engagement, high-engagement users actually churned less. <strong>The spike came from "zombie" subscribers who rarely used the product.</strong> The team let them churn and focused on converting engaged free users instead.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="metric-card" id="metric-conversion" data-tags="growth,engagement" data-name="Conversion Rate">
        <h3>Conversion Rate</h3>
        <p><em>Percentage of users who complete a goal action. Benchmarks: 2-3% e-commerce, 15-25% SaaS trial-to-paid.</em></p>
        <blockquote>Conversion Rate = (Users who completed action / Users who could have) × 100%</blockquote>
        <h4>What it measures</h4>
        <p> Percentage of users who complete a specific goal action. "Conversion" is context-dependent: it might mean signing up, subscribing, purchasing, or completing any defined step. Always specify what you're measuring (visitor-to-signup, trial-to-paid).</p>
        <h4>What to watch</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Rising</strong>: Your funnel is more effective. But check volume: optimizing for conversion can sometimes attract lower-intent visitors who inflate the denominator.</li>
          <li><strong>Falling</strong>: Something is blocking users. Use funnel analysis to find the drop-off point. Also check for audience mix shifts, as different traffic sources convert at different rates.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>In practice</h4>
        <p> An e-commerce site simplified checkout from 5 pages to 1 and saw conversion jump from 2.1% to 3.4%. But average order value dropped 15%. <strong>Users were impulse-buying smaller items.</strong> They added a "frequently bought together" prompt, which recovered AOV while keeping most of the conversion gain.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="metric-card" id="metric-far" data-tags="engagement,leading" data-name="Feature Adoption Rate">
        <h3>Feature Adoption Rate (FAR)</h3>
        <p><em>Percentage of eligible users who use a feature. Target: 50%+ for core features, 10-30% for secondary.</em></p>
        <blockquote>FAR = (Users who used the feature / Eligible users exposed to it) × 100%</blockquote>
        <h4>What it measures</h4>
        <p> Percentage of eligible users who use a specific feature. "Eligible" is key: measure against users who could use the feature (had access, saw it), not your entire user base.</p>
        <h4>What to watch</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Rising</strong>: The feature is finding its audience. Low adoption isn't always bad, as some features are for power users only.</li>
          <li><strong>Falling</strong>: Initial curiosity may be wearing off. Track whether users who try the feature continue using it (feature retention), not just first use.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>In practice</h4>
        <p> A project management tool launched a time-tracking feature with 45% adoption in week one, dropping to 12% by week four. <strong>Users liked the idea but found manual time entry tedious.</strong> The team added automatic tracking, and adoption stabilized at 38%: lower than the spike but sustainable.</p>

        <section class="metric-card" id="metric-pql" data-tags="growth,monetization,leading" data-name="Product-Qualified Leads">
        <h3>Product-Qualified Leads (PQLs)</h3>
        <p><em>Users whose product engagement signals conversion likelihood. Quality over quantity.</em></p>
        <blockquote>PQLs = Count of users meeting predefined engagement criteria<br>PQL Rate = (PQLs / Total trial or free users) × 100%</blockquote>
        <h4>What it measures</h4>
        <p> Users who have demonstrated meaningful product engagement that correlates with conversion likelihood. Unlike marketing-qualified leads (based on content engagement), PQLs are qualified by actual product usage.</p>
        <h4>What to watch</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Rising</strong>: More users are reaching meaningful engagement, which is good for pipeline. Track PQL-to-paid conversion to validate your criteria.</li>
          <li><strong>Falling</strong>: Fewer users are engaging deeply. Check if onboarding is broken, if traffic quality has declined, or if product changes have made the "aha moment" harder to reach.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>In practice</h4>
        <p> A SaaS company defined PQLs as "created 3+ projects and invited 1+ teammates." Sales closed 35% of PQLs vs. 8% of all trial users. When they added "used integration feature" to the criteria, <strong>PQL volume dropped 40% but close rate jumped to 52%</strong>. Better targeting made their sales team more efficient.</p>

        <section class="metric-card" id="metric-ttv" data-tags="engagement,leading" data-name="Time-to-Value">
        <h3>Time-to-Value (TTV)</h3>
        <p><em>Time from signup to first "aha moment." Target: first session for consumer, hours/days for B2B.</em></p>
        <blockquote>TTV = Median time from signup to first value event</blockquote>
        <h4>What it measures</h4>
        <p> Elapsed time from signup to a user's first meaningful value moment. You must define what "value" means for your product: completing a task, achieving a result, or reaching an "aha moment" feature. Use median to avoid outliers skewing results.</p>
        <h4>What to watch</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Shorter</strong>: Users reach value faster, which strongly correlates with retention. Best-in-class products aim for value within the first session.</li>
          <li><strong>Longer</strong>: Friction in onboarding, unclear value prop, or complex setup requirements. Map the user journey step-by-step to find where time is lost.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>In practice</h4>
        <p> A budgeting app had a median TTV of 4 days because users signed up but didn't link accounts until later. They added a "quick demo mode" with sample data so users could explore immediately. <strong>TTV for demo users was 8 minutes, and those users linked real accounts at 2× the rate.</strong></p>

        <section class="metric-card" id="metric-cac" data-tags="growth,monetization" data-name="Customer Acquisition Cost">
        <h3>Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)</h3>
        <p><em>Total cost to acquire a paying customer. The key ratio: LTV:CAC should be 3:1 or better.</em></p>
        <blockquote>CAC = (Sales + Marketing costs) / New customers acquired</blockquote>
        <h4>What it measures</h4>
        <p> Total cost to acquire a new paying customer, including marketing spend, sales salaries, tools, and overhead allocated to acquisition. Decide whether to include just direct costs (blended CAC) or fully-loaded costs including salaries.</p>
        <h4>What to watch</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Falling</strong>: Acquisition is more efficient, but verify quality. Cheaper customers may churn faster or spend less. Pair with LTV to ensure you're not sacrificing long-term value.</li>
          <li><strong>Rising</strong>: Competition is intensifying, or you've saturated easy-to-reach audiences. Segment by channel, as some channels scale poorly. If LTV rises faster than CAC, rising costs can still be profitable.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>In practice</h4>
        <p> A SaaS company saw paid search CAC rise from $120 to $180 over six months as competition increased. Content marketing CAC was $95 but took 6 months to show results. <strong>They maintained paid search for immediate pipeline while investing in content for long-term CAC reduction.</strong> Blended CAC stabilized at $135.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Metrics are only useful when they drive decisions. The best product teams don't just track these numbers; they connect them. LTV only matters relative to CAC. DAU means little without retention context. Activation predicts churn. Use this guide as a reference, but remember: the goal isn't perfect measurement. It's building a product people love, and metrics are just how you check if you're getting there.</p>
