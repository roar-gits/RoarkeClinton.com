              <h1>Professional Services Terms</h1>
              <p>Last Updated: January 2024</p>
              <p>These Professional Services Terms (&quot;Terms&quot;) govern your engagement of professional services (&quot;Service&quot;) provided by Roarke Clinton (&quot;Professional,&quot; &quot;we,&quot; &quot;us,&quot; or &quot;our&quot;). By subscribing to our Service, you (&quot;Client&quot; or &quot;you&quot;) agree to these Terms. We encourage you to read these Terms carefully, as they form the foundation of our professional relationship.</p>
              <p>‍</p>
              <h2>1. The Professional Service Relationship</h2>
              <h3>Nature of Service</h3>
              <p>We provide comprehensive professional services through a strategic advisory relationship. Our Service encompasses the full scope of our expertise, judgment, and capabilities applied in support of your objectives. This includes strategic guidance, operational insights, project support, and other professional contributions we determine may benefit you.</p>
              <h3>Service Foundation</h3>
              <p>The Service relationship is built on:</p>
              <ul role="list">
                <li>Our commitment to applying our expertise in support of your success</li>
                <li>The understanding that we serve as a trusted advisor, not a decision maker</li>
                <li>Recognition that our value stems from our judgment and insights, not merely time spent</li>
                <li>A shared interest in achieving meaningful outcomes, while acknowledging that results cannot be guaranteed</li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Professional Discretion</h3>
              <p>We maintain complete professional discretion in determining how to best deliver value within our Service relationship. This includes decisions about approach, methodology, timing, and implementation of any aspects of our Service.</p>
              <p>‍</p>
              <h2>2. Service Access and Availability</h2>
              <h3>Service Capacity</h3>
              <p>Each subscription package provides access to our Service up to a specified number of hours per month. This represents the maximum time we may dedicate to your needs during that period, not a commitment to deliver any specific number of hours. The value of our Service derives from our expertise and contributions, not from time spent.</p>
              <h3>Access Framework</h3>
              <p>Your subscription ensures our availability to engage with your needs up to your package&#x27;s capacity limit. We deliver this Service through various means, including strategic discussions, collaborative sessions, document review, analysis, and other professional activities we determine will best serve your objectives.</p>
              <h3>Service Delivery</h3>
              <p>We provide Service during business hours (Monday through Friday, 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM Pacific Time, excluding federal holidays), with off-hours availability as specified in your package. We maintain sole discretion over scheduling and implementation of all Service elements.</p>
              <p>‍</p>
              <h2>3. Investment in Professional Service</h2>
              <h3>Subscription Structure</h3>
              <p>We offer monthly, quarterly, and yearly subscription packages. Each package provides different levels of Service capacity and represents an investment in our professional expertise and availability. Multi-period subscriptions paid in advance qualify for preferential rates, reflecting the value of longer-term professional relationships.</p>
              <h3>Package Options</h3>
              <p>Current package offerings and their associated investment levels are displayed on our website. Each package defines:</p>
              <ul role="list">
                <li>Maximum monthly Service capacity</li>
                <li>Off-hours access terms</li>
                <li>Associated investment level</li>
              </ul>
              <p>We reserve the right to modify package offerings and investment levels at any time for new subscribers, while providing 30 days&#x27; notice of any changes affecting existing subscribers.</p>
              <h3>Investment Terms</h3>
              <p>All subscriptions require advance payment to activate Service access. Multi-period subscriptions must be paid in full to qualify for preferential rates. These rates reflect both the longer commitment and the advance payment.</p>
              <h3>Business Expenses</h3>
              <p>Reasonable expenses incurred in delivering our Service will be handled separately from subscription investments:</p>
              <ul role="list">
                <li>Expenses under $100 do not require advance approval</li>
                <li>Expenses over $100 require your explicit approval</li>
                <li>Travel arrangements require advance discussion and approval</li>
                <li>Expense documentation will be provided monthly</li>
                <li>Expense reimbursement is due within 15 days of documentation</li>
              </ul>
              <p>‍</p>
              <h2>4. Travel and On-Location Service</h2>
              <h3>Travel Arrangements</h3>
              <p>When travel is required to deliver our Service:</p>
              <ul role="list">
                <li>All arrangements require advance approval</li>
                <li>Travel time is compensated at $150 per hour</li>
                <li>Travel time is separate from package Service capacity</li>
                <li>Minimum 4 hours and maximum 8 hours billed per travel day</li>
              </ul>
              <h3>On-Location Service</h3>
              <p>Service delivered at your location:</p>
              <ul role="list">
                <li>Counts against package Service capacity</li>
                <li>Limited to 8 hours per day within package capacity</li>
                <li>Additional time subject to package off-hours terms</li>
                <li>Arrival and departure days counted based on actual Service delivery</li>
              </ul>
              <p>‍</p>
              <h2>5. Engagement Evolution</h2>
              <h3>Service Adaptation</h3>
              <p>Our Service naturally evolves as we develop deeper insight into your needs and as circumstances change. We maintain flexibility to adapt our approach to best serve your objectives within your subscription&#x27;s capacity limits.</p>
              <h3>Subscription Changes</h3>
              <p>You may modify your subscription level with 10 days&#x27; notice before your next Service period. Changes take effect at the start of the next period.</p>
              <h3>Early Conclusion</h3>
              <p>If either party determines the need to conclude the Service relationship before a prepaid subscription period ends:</p>
              <p>When initiated by you or due to challenges in our professional relationship:</p>
              <ul role="list">
                <li>We recalculate the value of delivered Service at standard rates</li>
                <li>The remaining balance, less the value of Service delivered, will be refunded</li>
                <li>This ensures fair compensation for Service provided while allowing relationship flexibility</li>
              </ul>
              <p>When initiated by us for reasons unrelated to the professional relationship:</p>
              <ul role="list">
                <li>We calculate your refund based on unused Service capacity at your original subscription rate</li>
                <li>This honors our commitment to your investment in the relationship</li>
              </ul>
              <p>All refunds are processed within 30 days of relationship conclusion.</p>
              <p>‍</p>
              <h2>6. Information Protection</h2>
              <h3>Confidential Information</h3>
